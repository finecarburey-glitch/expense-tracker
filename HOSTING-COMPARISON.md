- **Vendor Lock-in**: Harder to migrate away from Firebase
- **Complex Pricing**: Can be unpredictable at scale
- **Learning Curve**: Firebase-specific concepts to learn

### 💰 Free Tier Limits
- **Hosting**: 10 GB storage, 1 GB transfer/month
- **Functions**: 125K invocations, 40K GB-seconds/month
- **Good for**: Small to medium family usage

## 🔧 Migration Between Platforms

If you start with one platform and want to switch later:

### Firebase → Netlify
1. Export environment variables from Firebase config
2. Set up Netlify environment variables
3. Update build scripts
4. Deploy to Netlify
5. Update OAuth redirect URIs

### Netlify → Firebase
1. Set up Firebase project
2. Configure Firebase Functions
3. Update build scripts
4. Deploy to Firebase
5. Update OAuth redirect URIs

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Both Platforms:
1. **Test Locally First**: Use emulators before deploying
2. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on free tier limits
3. **Backup Data**: Regular Google Sheets exports
4. **Version Control**: Always use Git for deployments

### Firebase Specific:
- Use `firebase serve` for local testing
- Monitor function execution time to avoid timeouts
- Consider upgrading to Blaze plan for better performance

### Netlify Specific:
- Use `netlify dev` for local development
- Optimize function bundle size to reduce cold starts
- Consider Pro plan if you need longer function timeouts

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**For Family Expense Tracker specifically, we recommend Netlify** because:

1. **Better Performance**: Faster function cold starts mean better user experience
2. **Sufficient Free Tier**: 100 GB bandwidth is more than enough for family use
3. **Simpler Deployment**: Git-based deployment is easier to manage
4. **Google Sheets Integration**: Works perfectly with our Google Sheets backend

However, **Firebase is also excellent** if you prefer Google's ecosystem or plan to add more Google services later.

Both platforms will serve your family expense tracking needs perfectly! 🎉
